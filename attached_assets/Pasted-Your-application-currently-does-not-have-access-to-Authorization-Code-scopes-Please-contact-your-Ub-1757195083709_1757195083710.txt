Integration Steps
Integration Steps
Step 1: Select the scopes from the above list. Your selection will be saved for later

Step 2: First, the user has to grant your app permission to access their data or do actions on their behalf. Uber provides an authentication page where users can secure sign in with their Uber username and password to grant permissions to your app. This authorization page is accessible through the below authorization URL.

https://auth.uber.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=53GTRyfXoNF3oy-PdSlUGCNdrYGhgaX8&redirect_uri=<REDIRECT_URI>&scope=<SPACE_DELIMITED_LIST_OF_SCOPES>&response_type=code
Step 3: Once the Uber user authenticates and authorizes your app, Uber will issue an HTTP 302 redirect to the redirect_uri passed in previous step (or the first redirect URI in the dashboard if none was explicitly provided in previous step). On that redirect, you will have a single-use authorization code which will expire in 10 minutes. The AUTHORIZATION_CODE query param is the authorization code needed for next step.

GET <REDIRECT_URI>/?code=<AUTHORIZATION_CODE>
Step 4: Use the endpoint below to exchange the authorization code for an access_token which will allow you to make a request on behalf of the user. The access_token is good for a limited period of time described by the expires_in field (in seconds) in response.

Request
curl -F 'client_secret=YXbwOetL3w69toMetv69bNue_ajRcP_B1YFKZqsQ'\
      -F 'client_id=53GTRyfXoNF3oy-PdSlUGCNdrYGhgaX8'\
      -F 'grant_type=authorization_code'\
      -F 'redirect_uri=<REDIRECT_URI>\
      -F 'code=<AUTHORIZATION_CODE>'\
      "https://auth.uber.com/oauth/v2/token"
Response
{
 "access_token": "<ACCESS_TOKEN>",
 "token_type": "Bearer",
 "expires_in": "<EXPIRY_IN_EPOCH>",
 "refresh_token": "xxx",
 "scope": "<SPACE_DELIMITED_LIST_OF_SCOPES>"
}
Step 5: You can pass the <ACCESS_TOKEN> returned in the previous step as a bearer token in Authorization header, or pass it as a query parameter in the URL. See example below of OAuth sent in the header.

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"\
